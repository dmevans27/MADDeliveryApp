# MADDeliveryApp
A Mobile App Development Project By Derek Evans and Agyei Lomeni

A mobile delivery application that has interfaces for both drivers and users, and allows for the placement of food orders from sample restaurants with sample data by customers, and for the confirmation of pickup and deliveries by drivers. There is also a review system in place for restaurants, where customers can leave 1-5 star ratings and write comments about their experience.

Both members performed their duties and were able to complete the project. Agyei was very helpful and willing to assist when issues arose with accessing the reviews, which were located within collections within the restaurant collection, and Derek was able to format the Firebase to have cleaner UI display when identifying orders, users, and restaurants. We enjoyed working on this project, and for further steps we would plan to improve the UI appearance, implementing payment methods, partnering with real restaurants and connecting them with customers and improving upon the review system to also possibly allow both customers and drivers to review each other as well as restaurants.
