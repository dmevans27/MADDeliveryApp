# MADDeliveryApp
A Mobile App Development Project By Derek Evans and Agyei Lomeni

A mobile delivery application that has interfaces for both drivers and users, and allows for the placement of food orders from sample restaurants with sample data by customers, and for the confirmation of pickup and deliveries by drivers. There is also a review system in place for restaurants, where customers can leave 1-5 star ratings and write comments about their experience.

Both members performed their duties and were able to complete the project. Agyei was very helpful and willing to assist when issues arose with accessing the reviews, which were located within collections within the restaurant collection, and Derek was able to format the Firebase to have cleaner UI display when identifying orders, users, and restaurants. We enjoyed working on this project, and for further steps we would plan to improve the UI appearance, implementing payment methods, partnering with real restaurants and connecting them with customers and improving upon the review system to also possibly allow both customers and drivers to review each other as well as restaurants.

For operation instructions: to seperate between user and driver you have to select a role during registration. This role will lead you to seperate interfaces. If you'd like sample logins:

for customer:
email: user@test.com
password: test1234

for driver:
email: driver@driver.com
password: driver

Each interface will provide you with seperate options for running the program. To start for testing, I would recommend first becoming a user, as you will be able to create orders, which the driver interface depends upon. You can also view the review tabs. The flow of the application (in our opinion) is pretty intuitive, and the navigation drawer allows movement through pages for the user interface to help if a customer gets lost.

The drivers interface only has two pages, delivery information and delivery details, which both depend on an order, which at the time of writing this, there are no sample orders left unclaimed or open, so testing the user side first is mandatory at the time of writing this.

Note for the presentation: I did not mean to demo the entire project and steal Agyei's pages, he was very active in the presentation, working on the powerpoint and performed the editing for the final product. I got a bit too focused on showing how the status of firebase was updated between the driver's and customers interfaces, and ended up not leaving him a lot to present. -Derek
